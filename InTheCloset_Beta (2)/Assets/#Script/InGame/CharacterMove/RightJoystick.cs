                the inputVector (that will be output as the direction vector to control movement of a game object such as character or any desired game object) is created from these values
                the inputVector however is still unormalized, this means that if you drag outside of the boundaries of the image the values
                will continue to increase, also, dragging outside of the circular part of the image onto its transparent area will still register,
                so that dragging to a corner of the image (for example the bottom left corner) will give a value of x,y (-1,-1) which is not correct because the 
                the circular part of the image does not actually reach that far

                the solution to this (further down this script) will be to normalize the vector (remove it's magnitude) so that its value of x or y never increases past 1
